# Contributing to the eduNEXT TVM

# If you've got only the idea
If you do not have the ability to develop the idea but you need that solution, you will be able to [open a new feature request](https://github.com/eduNEXT/tvm/issues/new/choose)), if the idea is adopted by the community, this can be continued the next process, read __If you want contribute with code__

# If you want contribute with code
## Step 0: Join the Conversation
Got an idea for how to improve the codebase? Fantastic, we'd love to hear about it! Before you dive in and spend a lot of time and effort making a pull request, it's a good idea to discuss your idea with other interested developers and/or the eduNEXT product team. You may get some valuable feedback that changes how you think about your idea, or you may find other developers who have the same idea and want to work together.

### Repository Discussions
If you've got an idea for a new feature, please start a discussion in the [__ideas__](https://github.com/eduNEXT/tvm/discussions/categories/ideas) category of the github repository discussion to get feedback from the community about your idea.

## Step 1: Fork, Commit, and Pull Request
__This confirms that you have the authority to contribute the code in the pull request and ensures that eduNEXT can re-license it__

GitHub has some great documentation on [how to fork a git repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). Once you've done that, make your changes and send us a pull request! Be sure to include a detailed description for your pull request, so that a community manager can understand what change you're making, why you're making it, how it should work now, and how you can test that it's working correctly.

## Step 2: Meet PR Requirements
- Commits signed - [How to do it](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
- The commits respects conventional commits - [How to do it](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Repository actions are passing without problems.

## Step 4: Code Review by team TVM Maintainers member(s)
A team tvm maintainers member will read the description of your pull request. If the descriptions is understandable and your pull request meets the requirements listed in the contributor documentation (__read Meet PR Requirements__), then it will be reviewed by one or more core commiters.

Once the code review process has started, please be responsive to comments on the pull request, so we can keep the review process moving forward. If you are unable to respond for a few days, that's fine, but please add a comment informing us of that -- otherwise, it looks like you're abandoning your work!

## Step 5: Merge!
Once the team tvm maintainers members are satisfied that your pull request is ready to go, one of them will merge it for you. Congrats!
