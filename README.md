TVM is a tool that allows you to manage several Tutor development environments so that they work in isolation, and you can work on different projects with independent Tutor versions and configurations.

TVM is also the acronym for:

- **Tutor Version Manager:** Handle the Tutor versions.
- **Tutor enVironment Manager:** Create project-based environments with Tutor.

# Installing TVM

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eduNEXT/tvm.git

# Getting Started

Create and activate a new project with the following steps:

1. Install the version of Tutor you want to use with TVM.

   ```bash
   tvm install <tutor-version>

   # For example:
   # tvm install v14.0.0
   ```

2. Create a new project with TVM.

   ```bash
   tvm project init <project-name> <tutor-version>

   # For example:
   # tvm project init tvm-test v14.0.0
   ```

3. Open the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

4. Activate the project environment.
